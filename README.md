# Infocat metrics library for Datadog
([https://github.com/macrogreg/inca-metrics-dotnet](https://github.com/macrogreg/inca-metrics-dotnet))

This is a super-fast custom metrics collection, aggregation, and submission library for .NET

Infocat Metrics is primarily targeted at sending metrics to Datadog. However, it is completely generic and can be just as well used to send metrics to any backend or middleware.

For now, we are in an easy design phase. Please, be lenient in your judgement. Feedback is welcome. Thank you!
